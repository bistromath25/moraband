moraband chess engine in c++

From the Star Wars wiki:

Moraband, known in antiquity as Korriban, was an Outer Rim planet that was home to the ancient Sith.

I'm writing (making?) this chess engine over the course of my three-week winter break, so it could either be really good or really really good or a brick.

Based on the legendary [Vice](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Vice) chess engine (hopefully it'll be a bit stronger than Vice, who knows).
