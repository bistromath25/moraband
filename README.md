Moraband UCI chess engine in C++

From the [Star Wars wiki](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Moraband):

Moraband, known in antiquity as Korriban, was an Outer Rim planet that was home to the ancient Sith.

I'm writing (making?) this chess engine over the course of my three-week winter break, so it could either be really good or really really good or a brick.
